# Server Fleet Management: Plan of Action
## Entry Point for Training
1. application_training.py
## Entry Point for Actual
1. application.py (Does not have the import .joblib/.zip files code yet)

## Important to do
1. Check if the RL agent is taking care of the "RESETTING IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL STATE" AFTER TRYING ACTIONS... since I am new to RL; I am unsure if the library will take care of it. I'm unsure about this.
2. Calculations on Classes.py based on README.md (Hackathon Manual)
3. Reconsider the variables being shown on Obervation Space
4. etc...
