## Entry Point for Training
1. application_training.py

## Entry Point for Actual
1. application.py (Does not have the import .joblib/.zip files code yet)

## Important to do
1. Check if the RL agent is taking care of the "RESETTING IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL STATE" AFTER TRYING ACTIONS... since I am new to RL; I am unsure if the library will take care of it. I'm unsure about this. (Outdated as of Sep 3).
2. Calculations on Classes.py based on README.md (Hackathon Manual).
3. Reconsider the variables being shown on Obervation Space. (Outdated as of Sep 3)
4. Requesting team to go through my notes mentioned above, and comments in evaluation.py written by me - extremely helpful.. thank you, team. - @saisurisettigriffith

## Submission
1. RL was not working in the way we expected, time-constraint, more logical to find another approach given the 4 days remaining time-constraint.
2. Due to time constraints, we are submitting a basic "only buy action enabled" solution for now (Sep 3).
